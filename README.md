# Workout Buddy

## About

This is my second Milestone Project for my Full Stack Software Development Diploma with Code Institute. I will be using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for this project. The aim is to build on my front end skills by practising my HTML/CSS and implementing JavaScript interactive features. I will also be using the JQuery library for elements.

For this project, I am building a fitness app. The idea is that a user can quickly and easily create a home workout. Included will be some baked in exercises for the user to choose from, and a 'whiteboard' section where the chosen workout exercises will be added to the workout. I also plan to add an option for the user to add their own custom exercise.

The aim is to create a simple app to help people organise their exercise at home, which is more important than ever these days as a lot of us are stuck inside for most of the day.

### Strategy

I am looking to cast as wide a net as possible in terms of user base. This app needs to be designed to be used by both fitness newbies and veterans alike. 

#### User Stories

I am a fitness beginner and I want:

1. Instructions for how to perform exercises
2. Instructions must not be alienating and explanations should be easy to understand
3. A way to 'progress' their fitness level using the app
4. Positive feedback after completing a workout

I am a fitness 'veteran' and I want:

1. To be able to quickly construct my workout
2. To be able to add my own custom exercises
3. To be able to have a challenging workout
